# Are you kidding me? I was just there for a minute!

This project will track parking tickets in Boston and look for areas where large amounts of faulty tickets are issued.

#Goals of the project:
  *Allow residents to have a resource in fighting against possible undue tickets
  *Allow residents to see high-risk areas easily and take necessary precautions

#Intended features
  *Heatmap of areas by volume of tickets
  *Extendability to other cities by supplying a json file of that city's data
